## Discover more leads

There are a few ways to discover more leads. So let's get into some use cases for data enrichment that will take your sales to the next level and get you those wins you need.

1. ### CRM

   Nobody’s CRM is perfect. In fact, the reality is that most are very far from it. Salesforce has previously said that up to 91% of CRM data is incomplete.

   That means you have opportunities just waiting for you in your CRM. All you need to do is get more information to make them actionable. Maybe there are leads in the pipeline that are missing vital contact information or lack company details.

   Enrich those incomplete customers in your CRM to keep those opportunities moving down the pipeline instead of slipping through the cracks.

2. ### Web forms

   Web forms are great in brings in more leads, they even get you qualified ones. But they don't get you a lot of information you can actually use. Not to mention that the more details you ask in a form, the less likely they are to actually submit it.

   Lowering the barrier to submitting means you often end up with a lot of leads that give you nothing more than a name and an email. Not a lot to go off of.

   But with enrichment, you can turn those leads into the hot opportunities they are. Enrich your lead capture data to get those missing or incomplete data points that will help you make a sale.

3. ### Old opportunities

   It’s hard to go out there and find new opportunities from scratch. So instead of starting with a blank slate, go to your CRM first.

   Take a look at old opportunities that were abandoned a while ago or even some churned customers or closed/lost deals (especially if your offering has changed since that last conversation).

   Then enrich the contacts associated with them to make sure you’ve got the most up-to-date and accurate information on who to contact. It’s not just about re-opening that line of communication and making sure you’re talking to the right person, which is already pretty important on its own.

   But it’s also a good way to see what’s changed. Maybe a former champion has been promoted and has more sway in the decision. Or maybe a decision-maker has left the job and been replaced with someone new. Both of those situations mean you’ve got a fresh opportunity to pitch your solution again.

4. ### Event attendee

   Events like webinars or trade shows are a major way that marketing brings in leads for sales, but the information that comes from these events can be pretty sparse.

   You can use our data enrichment to take lists of names from events and turn them into something actionable. Adding details like job title and contact information takes the information you already have and gives you the details you need to qualify and contact leads.

5. ### Prioritization

   You don’t want to waste your time talking to leads that aren’t likely to convert. You want to go for the ones that will increase your sales ratio.

   Enrichment is a power-up for lead scoring. When you enrich your leads, you get all that extra contextual data that can help tell you how likely they are to convert based on how similar they are to your best customers.

## Finally

This is only scratching the surface of what you can do with data enrichment. We haven’t even touched on how your company can use it for crafting personas and segmentation. But for now, try out these five tactics to get some quick wins.
