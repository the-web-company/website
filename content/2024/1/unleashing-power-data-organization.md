## Export and Integration Capabilities

At TheWebCo we understands the importance of seamless integration with other tools and platforms. Lists offers users the ability to export their curated leads to various formats, including CSV, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. This interoperability ensures that the value derived from Lists extends beyond the platform itself, providing users with the flexibility to incorporate their data into their existing workflows.

To further enhance the organization of leads, Lists comes equipped with a robust tagging system. Users can easily add relevant tags to individual leads, enabling them to categorize and filter data with pinpoint precision. This feature is particularly valuable for users dealing with diverse datasets, allowing them to quickly locate and work with specific subsets of information.
