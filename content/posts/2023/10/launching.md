Today we have exciting news to share, we're launching our new website design ü•≥!! With the new design we want to take things further and emphasize the user journey, so everybody knows how much our users are important to us.

## Simpler

The first goal of the new design to make things simpler, simpler to understand. They say a picture worth a thousand words, so it's got to be simpler to understand things with a photo then a 1,000 words, right? With that in mind we recreate our main user journey right on the home screen, right at the start. This way we don't have to talk much, you can see the value we create with your own two eyes.

We got a great feedback about this user journey animation, so much so that we already start working on a new section of _Solutions_ that will highlight some more of our users journeys: for sales, for HRs, for VC's, and more. We think this will make things simpler to understand and digest and users will be able to understand the journey they are going to go through to unlock the unbelievable value we create üìà.

## Coherent

Right after the main user journey you can see some of our current user's feedback with a delightful gradient background composed from our logo colors ü´†. This gradient background will accompany you from time to time in few of the pages and elements in our website and will guide you through some of the importent things to keep an eye on.

Our emphasize is always on clean and coherent design language, but we think we finally been able to express ourselves the way we wanted from day one. We strive for perfection in our data, platform, service, operation and more, and now we hope you can see it also in our website.

## Clean

We're in love üòç with our clean and elegant design language, with lot of spaces and whites that make things breathable. So we put extrea time and effort to make sure our new website is up to our standards.

Throughout the website you'll see a lot of space and a lot of play with different font weights, sizes, and colors to make things pop and even sometimes partly hidden to not overwhelm the user. The challenge with surfacing the right data in the right way, at the right time, is at our core. As a big data company we encounter this challenge every day, we think about it every minute. It's a huge challenge and we strive to be the best at it üèÜ!

## More

There're a lot more things we changed in this new version, and we can talk about it for hours, but we prefer to let you experience it on your own and start your journey to unlock an unbelievable value together with us.
