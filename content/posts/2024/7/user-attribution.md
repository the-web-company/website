As the digital landscape evolves, so do the methods and technologies used to track user behavior online. One significant shift currently taking place is Google's decision to remove third-party cookies from its Chrome browser by 2024. This move marks a substantial change in how user attribution—identifying and attributing actions to specific users—is managed. Let's delve into what this means for marketers, advertisers, and anyone relying on web analytics.

## What Are Third-Party Cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a user's browser that track information about their browsing habits. Third-party cookies are created by domains other than the one the user is visiting directly. These cookies are commonly used by advertisers to track users across multiple sites, building detailed profiles to deliver personalized ads.

## Google's Decision to Remove Third-Party Cookies

Google's decision to phase out third-party cookies in Chrome, the world's most popular web browser, is part of a broader push towards enhancing user privacy. This follows similar moves by other browsers like Safari and Firefox. Google's rationale is to address growing privacy concerns and align with the increasing demand for more transparent data practices.

## The Impact on User Attribution

### Challenges:

1. **Reduced Cross-Site Tracking**: without third-party cookies, it becomes challenging to track user behavior across different websites. This disrupts traditional attribution models that rely on multi-site tracking to understand the user's journey.

2. **Limited Personalization**: advertisers and marketers will face difficulties in delivering personalized ads, which are based on users' cross-site behavior and preferences.

3. **Data Silos**: as third-party tracking diminishes, first-party data (collected directly by the site owner) becomes even more critical. However, this data is often siloed within individual platforms, making comprehensive user attribution harder to achieve.

### Opportunities:

1. **First-Party Data Focus**: Companies will need to place greater emphasis on collecting and leveraging first-party data. This involves directly engaging with users to gather information about their preferences and behaviors.

2. **Contextual Advertising**: Rather than relying on user profiles, advertisers can shift towards contextual advertising, where ads are served based on the content being consumed rather than the user's past behavior.

3. **New Attribution Models**: This change opens the door for innovative attribution models that do not depend on third-party cookies. For instance, solutions like Google's Privacy Sandbox aim to enable user tracking while preserving privacy through techniques like federated learning of cohorts (FLoC).

## Adapting to the New Normal

We at TheWebCo utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze the anonymous request across all touchpoints and developed a solution which enable customers to not only track users across all different sessions, in incognito mode, and even when switching browser and / or devices, but to really know the the person behind the request.
